                        <p>
                            I developed this application out of personal frustration during my journey of creating website clones 
                            while studying. 
                            I often struggled to accurately capture the colors from webpages. 
                            This frustration led to the creation of a React and TypeScript-based color finder tool. 
                            With this tool, users can effortlessly upload an image, utilize an 
                            eyedropper to pinpoint colors within the image, 
                            and instantly view the selected colors in an intuitive display.

                            When I’m not at the computer, I’m usually rock climbing, hanging out with my wife and two cats,
